# javascript-quiz

## Description
 This project involves building a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions related to JavaScript fundementals. The app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean responsive user interface.

The motivation behind this project is to help familiarize myself with coding assessments, such as those that may be given during an interview process. By building this app, I can use the skills covered in this module and gauge my progress.

The app solves the problem of helping users prepare for coding assessments by simulating a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. It also stores high scores so users can track their progress over time.

Through this project, I learned how to use JavaScript to manipulate HTML and CSS, as well as how to handle events, create functions, and dynamically update the webpage. I also learned how to store and retrieve data from local storage and use it to display high scores.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository on your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Jalzu1007/javascript-quiz.git

2. Navigate to the repository's directory using the command:

 cd javascript-quiz

3. Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the webpage.

## Usage

To use the JavaScript Coding Quiz, follow these steps:

1. Click the "Start Quiz" button to begin the timed quiz.
2. Read each multiple-choice question and select an answer.
3. If you select the correct answer, you will move on to the next question. If you select the incorrect answer, time will be subtracted from the clock.
4. After you have answered all questions or the timer runs out, the game will be over.
5. Enter your initials to save your score.
6. View high scores by clicking the "View High Scores" button.
